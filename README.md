# .vim

I symlink my `~/.vim` directory to this repo.  Similarly for `~/.vimrc` and `~/.gvimrc`.

I use voom and Pathogen to manage my plugins.  (I used to use git submodules but they turned out to be cluny and irritating.)

If you want to learn more about Vim, I heartily recommend these PeepCode screecasts:

* [Smash Into Vim](http://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-i)
* [Smash Into Vim II](http://peepcode.com/products/smash-into-vim-ii)

But don't take my word for it.  Look at [these Tweets](http://airbladesoftware.com/portfolio) instead.
