# .vim

I symlink my `~/.vim` directory to this repo.  Similarly for `~/.vimrc` and `~/.gvimrc`.

I use [voom][] and [Pathogen][] to manage my plugins.  (I used to use git submodules but they turned out to be clunky and irritating.)


## Learn more with PeepCode

If you want to learn more about Vim, I heartily recommend these ~~PeepCode~~ Pluralsight screecasts:

* [Smash Into Vim](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/smash-into-vim)
* [Smash Into Vim II](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/smash-into-vim)

But don't take my word for it.  Look at [these Tweets](http://airbladesoftware.com/portfolio) instead.
