INTRODUCTION                                                             *ack*

This plugin is a front for the Perl module App::Ack.  Ack can be used as a
replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run ack from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:Ack [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                  *:Ack*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

:AckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                            *:AckAdd*

    Just like |:Ack| + |:grepadd|.  Appends the |quickfix| with the results

:LAck [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                *:LAck*

    Just like |:Ack| + |:lgrep|.  Searches, but opens in |location-list|

:LAckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:LAckAdd*

    Just like |:Ack| + |:lgrepadd|.  Searches, but appends results to
    |location-list|

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

See |quickfix| and |:cnext| for more information about efficient
navigation in Quickfix window.

:AckG [options] {file_pattern} [{directory}]                           *:AckG*

    ack is also great for searching files by name, e.g. `ack -g user`
    will find all files, which have /user/ in its name. So this plugin
    can also act as an alternative to fuzzyfinder.vim
    :AckG user
    does the search and lists the files in the |Quickfix| window. Move
    with 'j', 'k' and press <Enter> to open the file.

You can also map the commands in your .vimrc with

nmap <silent> <unique> <Leader>a :Ack
nmap <silent> <unique> <Leader>g :AckG

Then use `\g user` in |Normal-mode| to search for files, that contain
`user` in its name or path or use `\a hello` to search for `hello` in
file content.
